                                            Heat 1/2 cup of the broth in a pot until simmering, add saffron and set
                                            aside for 10 minutes.

                                            Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over
                                            medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring
                                            occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a
                                            large plate and set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add
                                            pimentón, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and pepper, and cook,
                                            stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
                                            saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.

                                            peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed,
                                            15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and
                                            mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again without
                                            stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
                                            minutes more. (Discard any mussels that don&apos;t open.)
